# Beginners Scientific Programming with Python
## By Mohammad Bashiri
This workshop introduces the basic elements of Python programming language, as well as tools that are commonly used for data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and other applications. Participants will gain the knowledge needed to use Python in everyday tasks. This workshop is intended for scientists who are new to programming. No experience is required.
